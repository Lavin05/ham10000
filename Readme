This project implements a skin cancer prediction system that utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models including Xception, DenseNet, and ResNet. These models are compared in terms of performance and integrated into an interactive frontend website for user-friendly access.

## Overview

Skin cancer is a prevalent form of cancer, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This system leverages deep learning models trained on dermatoscopic images to predict whether a skin lesion is malignant or benign.

## Models Used

1. **Xception**
   - **Description:** Xception is a deep convolutional neural network architecture known for its depthwise separable convolutions, offering improved computational efficiency and parameter reduction while maintaining performance.
   - **Usage:** Xception model is employed for skin cancer prediction due to its high accuracy and efficiency in image classification tasks.

2. **DenseNet**
   - **Description:** DenseNet is a densely connected convolutional neural network architecture characterized by dense connections between layers, facilitating feature reuse, enhancing gradient flow, and improving learning efficiency.
   - **Usage:** DenseNet model is utilized for skin cancer prediction to exploit its ability to capture fine-grained features and alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem.

3. **ResNet**
   - **Description:** ResNet (Residual Network) is a deep neural network architecture featuring skip connections, enabling the training of very deep networks by mitigating the vanishing-gradient problem.
   - **Usage:** ResNet model is included in the comparison to evaluate its performance in skin cancer prediction tasks against more recent architectures like Xception and DenseNet.

## Frontend Website

The skin cancer prediction system is integrated into an interactive frontend website to provide a user-friendly interface for users to upload skin lesion images and receive predictions. The website allows users to compare predictions from different models and explore additional information about skin cancer.

## Usage

1. **Upload Image:** Users can upload a dermatoscopic image of a skin lesion via the frontend website.
2. **Prediction:** The uploaded image is processed by the selected deep learning model (Xception, DenseNet, or ResNet) to predict whether the skin lesion is malignant or benign.
3. **Comparison:** Users can compare predictions from different models to assess their performance and reliability.
4. **Additional Information:** The website provides additional information about skin cancer, risk factors, and preventive measures to educate users about the importance of early detection and prevention.
